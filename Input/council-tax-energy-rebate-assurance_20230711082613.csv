The Electoral database assisted with this. Customers were contacted where there were mismatches to determine liability. A number of non-resident landlords were identified and excluded in this way. Payment by Bacs were not issued until it was determined who the bank details belonged to. Where they could not be resolved payment was not issued at all until contact made. Before any Bacs payments were issued checks were done on all bank details held to identify any that were being used to pay Council Tax at more than 1 property and these cases were excluded and the liable persons contacted to determine whether they were resident or whether they were non-resident landlords or using a property as a second home etc. Only once all checks were completed and exclusions removed was a list of property references run through the module for payment to be made by Bacs at those addresses. Payments made by voucher underwent all the same checks as regards to liability and property band etc, but we also used the council Tax forecasting report to exclude anyone we did not hold full names for as we did not want to issue vouchers in the name of P Smith that would be easy to fraudulently redeem.","Regular running of the Energy Rebate report to identify any accounts that were no longer liable. Ctax team to inform when ended liability prior to 01/04/22 or applied an empty discount or exemption covering 01/04/22. Our front-line customer facing service were also made aware of the need to contact the main administrator of the scheme if they received information that could affect eligibility for the Energy Rebate payment. Also ran the Council Tax Forecasting report (report that extracts all liability data related to every live and closed council tax account for a specified year) on a twice monthly basis and matched this to the Energy Rebate report to identify any changes with specific regard to backdated empty exemptions or empty discounts. After the initial large batches of payments that passed the verification checks were issued, smaller batches were paid after checks were carried out on individual accounts by the main Administrator for this scheme which allowed us to retain a high degree of control over the payments made. This vastly reduced the capacity for errors along with all the controls put in place at the start such as manually excluding various accounts based on bank details being in use on more than one property or having a different postal addresses to the property address. Putting these tight controls in place allowed us to be much more confident in the correct issue of payments, especially for the area’s most at risk of errors in payment such as paying to a non-resident landlord. ","dd-bacs po-vouchers council-tax-credits","no","","","56567","1722","yes","The Civica OpenRevenues Energy Rebate module produced a list of such cases and excluded them from bulk payment. This exception list was then worked through manually by a dedicated team to determine whether payment was appropriate at all within the rules of the scheme, or whether it needed to be paid by Post Office voucher. In some cases there was a mismatch just because the liable person’s name had been misspelt on either the account or the bank account details so this could be corrected and paid by Bacs. A number of liable persons were contacted by email or phone (by Revenues Caseworkers trained in contacting customers about sensitive financial matters) to ascertain who was paying their Direct Debit. Some cases could be paid after corrections for name changes such as marital names needing to be updated. When notified of these, cross checks were made against the Electoral Register before payment by Bacs was issued. We manually processed some cases by Bacs who had an appointee (after contacting the appointee) or who provided copies of their bank statements. Our front line service were also contacted by some liable persons enquiring as to the payment of their Energy Rebate and we were able to obtain information via that channel as well as our front line service are trained to perform security checks before discussing accounts.","The only third parties paid were those who had official appointees dealing with their financial affairs so they would not be acting under duress.","The Energy Rebate module also rejected cases where the bank details had changed in-between the last Direct Debit payment being taken and the Energy Rebate payment being made. These cases were usually paid by voucher if deemed eligible. Cross checks were also performed to identify bank accounts that were in use across more than one Council Tax account. This identified a number of second homes or non-resident landlords and also cases where there was a name match but it was because a daughter was paying her mother’s council tax as well as her own for example. Vouchers were issued for those cases.","photo-id voucher address","","24690","3988375","4021","637775","yes","Daily reports were received notifying us of expired vouchers (expired vouchers cannot be redeemed after expiry date). These were either paid by Bacs where a successful Direct Debit payment had now been made or input onto the account as a credit. A list of non-redeemed vouchers was obtained from the Post Office reports at the end of the scheme and this list (after confirmation was received from the Post Office that the vouchers has been cancelled or had expired) was then converted into a credit onto the Council Tax account. We did receive some requests to cancel vouchers and pay by Bacs after a successful Direct Debit payment or convert into a credit on the Council Tax. These were paid only after confirmation was received from the Post Office that the voucher had been cancelled and not redeemed.","Any unpaid vouchers that had not been redeemed were recalled from the Post Office or they reached their expiry date and the Post Office notified us that they had expired and not been redeemed. ","","","","","","","","","","","7","Manual checks were performed to ensure occupied liability on 01/04/22, property was in the correct Band and the liable person had not received an Energy Rebate payment elsewhere as far as is possible through name searches and checking the property history. Also checked to make sure there were no away addresses on live accounts that may indicate this person lived elsewhere. A list of ‘ineligible cases’ had been complied during the scheme and this was also cross checked against before awarding a payment. For the discretionary scheme as well as the above, checks were done to ensure that Council Tax Support was still in payment or was now in payment on 01/04/22. If payment had been made already by a Post Office voucher then we requested a cancellation and waited until confirmation had been received before paying the energy Rebate by other means. ","5568","An enhancement was applied to the Civica Energy Rebate module to enable us to mass convert any expired vouchers at the end of September into council tax credits. A list was obtained from Post Office reports of remaining unredeemed vouchers at the end of the scheme and this list was uploaded into the Energy Rebate extract. This then performed all the standard checks for occupied liability on 01/04/22, that it was in the correct Council Tax Band etc. This identified a few exceptions where exemptions had been applied and the property was now empty or they were no longer liable on 01/04/22 and these payments were removed from the accounts instead of being converted. Manual conversions were also done on a number of vouchers that expired before the scheme ended (there was a 3 month time limit on the vouchers) or had returned post. Checks were done to ascertain ongoing occupied liability, correct banding etc. We also had to pay the Energy Rebate as a credit on the council tax account for a number of cases where it was too late to issue a Post Office voucher due to the core scheme ending at the end of September. The liable persons would not have had sufficient time to redeem their voucher. This was also the case with the discretionary payments that were identified in October or November. We had already closed the Post Office scheme down at that point and so applied a credit to their Council Tax account. Where a credit was applied, a new Council Tax bill was issued notifying them of the credit on their account or their new recalculated and lower instalments that took the credit into account. ","","","","Civica OpenRevenues Energy Rebate module performs various checks to ensure liability on an occupied charge on 01/04/22 on Bands A-D or E with Disabled Relief. Automatically excludes HMOs and empty properties. Restricts anyone from awarding higher amount that £150 for the Core Scheme. Also checked the bank name matched the name of the liable person which allowed us to identify not resident landlords and that the bank account details had not changed since the last Direct Debit payment was made before issuing a Bacs payment which prevented fraudulent Bacs payments. All this underwent robust testing before any payments issued. Same checks were done for manually applied payments. When inputting a payment manually error message appears if incorrect property chosen or if the property is empty or does not have liability on 01/04/22. The file for the issue of Post Office vouchers went through the same checks using the software provided. Manual checks were also made to ensure robustness and provide assurance vouchers were only issued to qualifying households. The Post Office were required to use photo identity and proof of address in order to redeem vouchers.","Manual checks were made on payment files and a large amount of resource was put into ensuring our data was cleansed prior to the commencement of any payments. This included cross checks with Electoral Register, HMO records and historic correspondence.

Initially, the council undertook a modelling exercise in order to ascertain what accounts were eligible and what were not. This data was obtained by our IT support team and then passed to our council tax team to filter and check. the data was then split into those that we held bank details and those we did not. Those that we held bank details were passed to a separate team to upload for payment which our finance team then processed. at each stage a different team was used in order to check the previous teams work and to separate duties to ensure fraud and error was minimised. For those without bank details an application for was needed. This needed a two-factor authentication (council tax number and pin number) the pin number was sent by letter/email without the council tax number and the customer needed to have both in order to apply. The application then had to be verified by an officer before passing through the payment stage which again looked for duplicates on the bank account and sort code details. The verification stage also looked for duplicates and highlighted these to the verifier. As the council controlled the gateway it stopped fraudsters applying with fraudulent council tax numbers as these were subject to our modelling and then assigned a pin. This was a different system to our council tax data and stopped staff or customers fraudulently setting up accounts or applying.","A risk assessment was carried out regarding the scheme to see how effective the measures were in preventing fraud and error. The overall risk score came out as low on the RAG report with most risk factors either being Green or amber with no red. Following the closure of the scheme a 1% sample of cases was taken from those paid via bank details held on the council tax system (350). These were run through spotlight and then manual checks conducted on those flagged red (address for bank account doesn't match council tax, deceased). This then gave an error rate of less than 1% across the scheme","no","0","N/A","0","no","","The council has a number of policies in place to prevent fraud by employees. These include a Anti-Fraud, Theft and Corruption Policy, Whistleblowing and Employee codes of conduct. In addition to our policies all work was supervised and checked by managers at each stage. This included obtaining data from underlying system, checking data, setting PIN codes, validating account applications, payment files and bacs runs. Furthermore, each stage was handled by a different department so for the lists were checked by the Council tax team, Applications were validated by customer service, approved file was passed for payment by IT and payment was made by finance. In addition, the system looked for duplication in telephone numbers, emails, bank accounts, sort codes and reference numbers. Any sign of duplication was flagged by the system for checking.","Of the 122 accounts so far found that were paid in error an invoice has been raised asking for the money to be repaid. This has been followed up with a phone call and email in the first instance and a subsequent letter to try and recover payment.","Currently there are 31 accounts that have not repaid the debt (We have 8 cases that we will be invoicing in the new year). We will continue to chase these using our normal 3 step process of invoice and letter, second letter and then final letter. Phone calls and or emails will also be sent.

No payment was made in this instance as we cancelled the voucher. Customer – complex case with differing stories being told by the customer.

We used our software supplier reports to identify cases and supplemented this with other reports as necessary We wrote to every recipient regardless of how they were being paid. To explain the scheme and how they could opt out. We explained that payments made in error would have to be repaid. Where we credited a payment to their Council Tax we additionally issued a revised bill at that time, highlighting that there had been a change. Where we did not have a live direct debit, applications for a direct payment had to be made on line. Our smart form only allowed a direct payment to be claimed where our records showed that the taxpayer was eligible. Applicants had to provide their account reference and confirm their name and address - only where these matched our records could they proceed to claim the payment. We chose not to use third parties (vouchers) to minimise the risk of paying the same household twice, or fraud and error creeping in through that third party process. We did not have the resources to provide the level of management and reconciliation that we felt would be required for this option. New stages were tested and double checked before we progressed to ensure that they were robust. Where we made an offer but prior to payment discovered that the taxpayer was not eligible as the result of a retrospective change in liability we withdrew the offer. We did not keep a separate note of these numbers. Now the schemes have closed we will carry out a post payment check of multiple payments to the same bank account . We believe all our prepayment checks have minimised the risk of fraud, however there is a small risk around direct debit payers due to the speed of payment and volume involved.

All staff have been DBS checked. Multiple staff worked on the scheme with the result that no individual could guarantee that their work would not be scrutinised by another. The level of collusion required and the risk to careers minimised the risk of employee fraud. Where we could automate the process we did. For example the application form captured the bank details from the customer and placed them on the payment record ready for spotlight checks. For direct debits the software checked that a direct debit payment had been made and then used the same bank details to generate the payment.","Where we made an offer but prior to payment discovered that the taxpayer was not eligible as the result of a retrospective change in liability we withdrew the offer.

Datatank then undertook the following • Error checked the list for missing data, duplicates, erroneous address details, & unique council tax reference number • Contacted the liable taxpayer by letter asking them to log onto a secure online portal to register for the rebate & submit their details. Claimants were given a set period of time to claim via the portal & advised their council tax account will be credited with the rebate (rather than a payment being made) if they don’t respond before the deadline. • The online form gave the taxpayer the option to request a payment to their bank account or credit the rebate to their council tax account. If a payment to bank account was requested, real time bank verification & validation took place via TransUnion to check the claimant's bank account details to prevent fraud.

The portal was tried and tested as they were utilised successfully in awarding Covid Business Grants. (Apply4.Online – Ascendant Solutions). Access was restricted to a small number of Council Officers. The Council identified households eligible for the scheme as of 1st April, this was reviewed throughout the scheme and only eligible households, were able to apply via the portal. The Council was able to set a maximum payment limit to reduce the risk of overpayment. The portal software denied any applications for a payment in respect of an address where a payment had already been made. The portal also denied applicants the ability to submit multiple applications. Applications were risk profiled using counter fraud identification and prevention methods to assess the information provided, including checking bank details. Where there were any cases that had a high risk score, user intervention by our Anti-Fraud Team who reviewed each case in detail before determining whether payment could be authorised. Applicants uploaded their bank statements and proof of address to provide assurance. Individual applications had to be made for any Discretionary Fund payments made through post office vouchers. The application required name, address, date of birth and NI number of the resident. This information was cross checked against HB, CTax Support/account records through our existing software and DWP Searchlight. Barcodes are held securely with access via password control limited to a small number of managers. Successful Residents were notified in writing. Details of the payment and the unique barcode reference for encashment through a local PO. For each payment made internal records are kept of the customer name, address and reference, amount paid, unique bar code reference, awarding officer and senior manager authorising the payment. This allows for regular reconciliation between barcodes issued and encashment at a PO.","As detailed above, the portal utilised to administer the scheme had built in anti-fraud and error functionality. The Council’s anti-fraud team reviewed every case that was highlighted as potentially high risk before determining whether payment could be authorised or denied.

The software would not allow us to make a payment if the resident was not eligible as at 1 April or if a payment had already been made on the council tax reference. Initially, accounts where we had outstanding correspondence were removed from the process to reduce error as outstanding correspondence may have contained changes of address.","Our software would not allow us to make a payment if the council tax account wasn't live as at 1 April 2022 or if the council tax account had already received a payment. We ran some enquiries against all Property References and residents Personal Identification Numbers in early October to identify where any duplicate payments had been made in relation to properties or people.

If the details still didn't match we invited the resident to make an application for the rebate rather than paying them directly.","We had a two stage authentication in the application process. To apply, the resident was sent a unique reference identifier in the application letter, but also had to provide their council tax reference which had been sent to them previously in March with their annual council tax demand, so the resident needed two separate pieces of information to apply that had been sent to them separately.","All direct debit payers where we paid the rebate automatically were identified for eligibility via the extract referenced in Q2 above.

The software didn't allow a payment to be made where the council tax account had already been paid of if the council tax account wasn't live as at 1 April 2022.","","","","Core scheme Residents were identified as eligible for the rebate by running the extract provided by our supplier. This enabled us to identify eligibility as at 1 April, if paying by direct debit a payment had been taken recently, and if the bank account details held in the system matched to the person liable for council tax. Where we were able to pay the payment to a direct debit payer directly this payment was followed up with a letter detailing eligibility and advising that the resident should advise us if they weren't eligible. Where residents were identified as eligible but we didn't hold bank details we sent an application letter inviting them to apply for the rebate via an online form. The application letter contained a unique online access key. In order to complete the application process online the resident needed to input both their unique access code (provided in the application letter) plus their council tax reference number, which will have been sent with the resident's council tax bill in March. Where residents were unable to complete the online application form and phoned the Council, a member of staff completed the application form on their behalf but only after the resident had been asked to provide both their council tax reference number and their unique access code. Discretionary rebate scheme We identified residents that would be eligible under our discretionary scheme criteria. Where we had already made a payment under the core scheme we paid the discretionary rebate and followed that up with a letter detailing our eligibility criteria. Those residents where we didn't hold the bank details were invited to apply. The application letter detailed our criteria and also contained a unique access code. We created an online application form. In order to apply we again had a two stage authentication process as the resident not only had to provide their unique access code, but also their date of birth and national insurance number.","We held meetings with our audit colleagues to talk through our approach and seek assurance that we were in line with best practise and that sufficient controls were in place to minimise the risk of fraud and error. We also periodically checked accounts where payments had been made to confirm the resident was eligible for the rebate. We have kept a record of all our our payment extracts by type (BACS DD, BACS non DD, Voucher, Council Tax Credit), and have reconciled the total payments by payment type back to the individual payments on council tax accounts that are recorded in our core revenues system. We have also reconciled all of the post office voucher requests sent to the Post Office, to the council tax records for this payment type","no","0","N/A","0","no","","We have kept a record of all our our payment extracts by type (BACS DD, BACS non DD, Voucher, Council Tax Credit), and have reconciled the total payments by payment type back to the individual payments on council tax accounts that are recorded in our core revenues system. All payments made are linked to council tax accounts so any fraudulent activity by staff in trying to intercept a payment would have been identified by a resident not receiving their payment.","Where we have identified ineligible payments that were made to the council tax account we have reversed the credit and rebilled. Where we have identified ineligible payments that were made via BACS we have written to the resident and provided our bank details to enable them to repay the money to us.","We will write to them again and request that they repay the money. We may then raise a sundry debt invoice.","We have identified 179 ineligible payments that have come about due to a subsequent adjustment in the council tax liability, and where it is apparent that the newly created council tax account for that individual would have qualified for the rebate in respect of their new liability, we have netted off the ineligible payment and noted this on their account thus ensuring the taxpayer does receive the benefit of the rebate. For example, if the payment was made in respect of a council tax account for Mr Smith, and then the account was deleted prior to 1 April and a new qualifying council tax account created in he name of Mr and Mrs Smith, we have offset the energy rebate payment initially to Mr Smith that had been made on in respect of his old (no longer eligible account) against his new council tax account.","26850","Ludlow","E14000799","4248300","154790","28322","","1764","1493","North Shropshire","E14000849","5622450","203830","37483","","2490","2258","Shrewsbury and Atcham","E14000926","6021900","202340","40146","","2549","2370","The Wrekin","E14000992","798300","21460","5322","","271","244","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This group met on a regular basis throughout the project. They attended webinars hosted by varying external organisations such DLUHC, IRRV, Capita and the Cabinet Office. An early draft risk assessment for the core scheme was created in March 2022 and updated in April and May as software solutions became available. Our software supplier Capita designed & created a bespoke solution to assist with the project. We ran reports to identify any CTAX accounts with data issues, so these could be manually corrected to allow automatic payments to be run. Accounts were marked when payments had been made reducing the risks of double payments. CTAX accounts could be manually marked with exclusion markers preventing a payment to a household. The system also included an application process for those deemed ineligible for an automatic payment so we could mailshot eligible households with a link to enable a manual applications to be made. The on-line application process was made safer by the fact that the applicant needed to enter their CTAX reference number, the name appearing on the CTAX account and the post code of the applicant property all of which had to be correct otherwise the application was immediately rejected. The Counter Fraud Manager attended webinars hosted by the Spotlight Team. All applications were run through Spotlight’s bank checking tool.","The eligibility criteria was widely publicised throughout the Revenues & Benefits Department to ensure that all officers were fully aware of which households were eligible, which accounts would receive automatic payments, which accounts would need to submit an application for the rebate and what the application process looked like. All Revenues staff and Counter Fraud staff were given access to the on-line application tool which meant staff were able to review application details whilst speaking to tax payers during routine customer enquiry telephone conversations or during targeted review programmes. All dubious applications were immediately reported to the Council Fraud Team for further investigation. The payment process was controlled centrally by the Control Team this meant that the authorisation of all payments was via a senior manager and team leader with built in checks for duplication and non-eligibility checks. The bank verification and bank accounts checking processes were controlled by the Counter Fraud Manager and his team. The Cabinet Office’s Spotlight tool was used to run bank verification checks. Over 2,500 on-line applications failed this bank check (at least one of the RAG areas was returned as red). These applications were manually checked by trained officers within the Counter Fraud Team. Applicants were asked to uploaded physical evidence relating to the bank account due to receive the rebate payment. This evidence was reviewed in order to establish a definitive link to both the person paying the Council Tax and the address at which the rebate was being claimed. The ultimate fall-back position was for the authority to pay the rebate direct onto the Council Tax account this would mean that any tax payer wanting the money paid into a bank account would have to satisfy the Council Tax Section’s robust internal refund process requiring that applicant to provide a form of identification and further proof of the receiving bank account.","no","0","N/A","0","no","","The ability to create a payment was tightly controlled.

Further discussions with Ascendant also indicated we could further filter the data relating to bank account details, email addresses (where the claimant had applied through the contact centre and thus the same email address had been used more than once) and minor data mismatches.

This group met on a regular basis throughout the project. They attended webinars hosted by varying external organisations such DLUHC, IRRV, Capita and the Cabinet Office. An early draft risk assessment for the core scheme was created in March 2022 and updated in April and May as software solutions became available. Our software supplier Capita designed & created a bespoke solution to assist with the project. We ran reports to identify any CTAX accounts with data issues, so these could be manually corrected to allow automatic payments to be run. Accounts were marked when payments had been made reducing the risks of double payments. CTAX accounts could be manually marked with exclusion markers preventing a payment to a household. The system also included an application process for those deemed ineligible for an automatic payment so we could mailshot eligible households with a link to enable a manual applications to be made. The on-line application process was made safer by the fact that the applicant needed to enter their CTAX reference number, the name appearing on the CTAX account and the post code of the applicant property all of which had to be correct otherwise the application was immediately rejected. The Counter Fraud Manager attended webinars hosted by the Spotlight Team. All applications were run through Spotlight’s bank checking tool.","The eligibility criteria was widely publicised throughout the Revenues & Benefits Department to ensure that all officers were fully aware of which households were eligible, which accounts would receive automatic payments, which accounts would need to submit an application for the rebate and what the application process looked like. All Revenues staff and Counter Fraud staff were given access to the on-line application tool which meant staff were able to review application details whilst speaking to tax payers during routine customer enquiry telephone conversations or during targeted review programs. All dubious applications were immediately reported to the Council Fraud Team for further investigation. The payment process was controlled centrally by the Control Team this meant that the authorisation of all payments was via a senior manager and team leader with built in checks for duplication and non-eligibility checks. The bank verification and bank accounts checking processes were controlled by the Counter Fraud Manager and his team. The Cabinet Office’s Spotlight tool was used to run bank verification checks. Over 2,500 on-line applications failed this bank check (at least one of the RAG areas was returned as red). These applications were manually checked by trained officers within the Counter Fraud Team. Applicants were asked to uploaded physical evidence relating to the bank account due to receive the rebate payment. This evidence was reviewed in order to establish a definitive link to both the person paying the Council Tax and the address at which the rebate was being claimed. The ultimate fall-back position was for the authority to pay the rebate direct onto the Council Tax account this would mean that any tax payer wanting the money paid into a bank account would have to satisfy the Council Tax Section’s robust internal refund process requiring that applicant to provide a form of identification and further proof of the receiving bank account.","no","0","N/A","0","no","","The ability to create a payment was tightly controlled.

Sometimes the officer would ask questions about their residency to establish eligibility. We also advised that if they nominate a third party, the resident/eligible person is still classed as receiving the rebate. Although ascendant was populated with data from our council tax system, sometimes by the time the payment was generated, changes could have been updated in the back-office system.

Contact was made with the liable person to resolve the discrepancy. Where the CTax liable person & direct debit bank account name matched (along with the other core criteria), the rebate was paid once the first Council Tax payment had been collected for Council Tax. An extract of eligible (non-dd) households that met the core criteria was uploaded to Datatank Ltd secure data transfer hub. Datatank then undertook the following • Error checked the list for missing data, duplicates, erroneous address details, & unique council tax reference number • Contacted the liable taxpayer by letter asking them to log onto a secure online portal to register for the rebate & submit their details. Claimants were given a set period of time to claim via the portal & advised their council tax account will be credited with the rebate (rather than a payment being made) if they don’t respond before the deadline. • The online form gave the taxpayer the option to request a payment to their bank account or credit the rebate to their council tax account. If a payment to bank account was requested, real time bank verification & validation took place via TransUnion to check the claimant's bank account details to prevent fraud. The following details were checked: • Datatank processed all the claimant responses & provided the council with the following details with a file containing the relevant details The NEC extract was run at regular intervals to identify any new eligible households & households who had been paid, but subsequently became ineligible due to retrospective changes.

To successfully submit an application, the application must have been completed using details exactly as they appear on our Council Tax records. The system was designed to ensure only the Council Tax account holder could proceed with an application, as only they would have had access to their unique account information, and only once they had received their code, limiting the potential for mail fraud and ensuring only the liable party could gain access to payment. If customers opted to pay to a 3rd party, they had to read and check a declaration box to confirm they had double checked the details supplied and were happy for payment to be made to them.","Where customers were supported to make claims, any individual concerns were flagged at the time and customers were supported to have the payment processed to their bank account only, or opt for an account credit if they didn't have sufficient bank details.

Experian credit checking and bank verification software was also implemented to prevent fraud. NAFN updates were regularly monitored, and spot checking was conducted on payments processed to ensure eligibility and prevent fraud.

Again a full media campaign was undertaken to promote the availability of the rebate to all eligible residents and those whom had not contacted for their payment were sent individual correspondence including letters, emails and text messages.

We determined that the most effective solution was to combine software provided by NEC (formerly Northgate) and Ascendant Solutions. These two pieces of software were subsequently procured and implemented. We did consider the use of the government’s Spotlight software, for identity and bank account checks, but initial review of this product showed that it did not meet our requirements. The software procured from NEC provided us with the ability to extract relevant Council Tax data from our core system. The software extracted data in excel format which was analysed in detail by a team of officers before relevant taxpayer records were subsequently uploaded into the Ascendant Solutions software. The Ascendant Solutions software provided a core processing system which we tailored to our requirements, creating several individual schemes to facilitate the administration of the overall energy rebate. These schemes captured criteria to confirm eligibility as well as conducting both identity checks and bank account checks, where required, prior to payments of an award being made. Following these check each potential energy rebate award was flagged red, amber or green, with further eligibility checks being undertaken as required. The checks conducted using the Ascendant Solutions software would then be verified using teams of officers who could review cases as required approving an award or requesting additional information and/or evidence from applicants in order to make an award or deny an application. Additional checks were performed by our quality assurance team.","All awards under our discretionary scheme were identified using up to date data from our council tax and benefit records. These records were interrogated to confirm whether eligibility criteria had been met for all households that we identified as eligible or we received an application from. We will continue to monitor any changes to our records that might retrospectively change a household’s entitlement to a discretionary award. Should such circumstances arise, we will consider whether it is appropriate recover the rebate award, based upon the individual circumstances of each case.","dd-bacs council-tax-credits","yes","ascendant","","0","0","yes","Instances where the bank account did not match the named taxpayer were identified using the Ascendant Solutions software which flagged such cases as red. All taxpayers were contacted and asked to provide explanation and/or evidence as required. Many of these instances were resolved without the need to contact a charge payer as they were a consequence of the NEC system’s requirement to nominate one liable party as a ‘primary party’. This meant that many such cases were wrongly flagged as a third-party bank account when they were in fact a joint taxpayer. Others that provided a reasonable explanation were paid, for example where two residents lived together with one named as the taxpayer and the other paying the council tax bill or where the discrepancy was due to name change (i.e marriage). For a third-party payment to be approved an applicant was required to provide a good reason why they were not able to receive a payment into their own account. A statement from the person liable for Council Tax was required to authorise a third-party payment. It had to state the full name, address and Council Tax reference number. It had to confirm the reason they are requesting a third-party payment. The statement also had to include the details of the third parties account including account name, number and sort code. ","Our decisions were based on interrogation of our own records, the information submitted on the application form, on the statement provided by the liable person and any other information provided prior to making a decision on the form. As mentioned above, the applicant had to confirm their reasons for requesting a third party payment. ","The Ascendant Solutions software that was procured provided a core processing system. The system captured criteria to confirm eligibility as well as conducting both identity checks and bank account checks, where required, prior to payments of an award being made. Those taxpayer that were paid directly to their bank accounts (as they paid Council Tax by direct debit) went through a pre-payment check in the Ascendant software, resulting in a ‘confidence score’ and a red, amber green flag. Those flagged as green (over 80% match on name held for CTax liability compared to bank account) were accepted as eligible. Those that were Amber (50% - 80% match) and Red (below 50%) had staff intervention to check the name match between that held on the bank account and the CTax liability. If the lower matching score could be explained using existing information held (e.g. mis-spelling, evidenced maiden name) they were accepted as eligible. Where the name mis-match couldn’t be explained, using existing records, a letter was issued to the liable party to state that there was a mismatch requesting a statement to confirm if they were happy for the Energy Rebate payment to be made to the account with which they pay their CTax. If the written statement was received it was approved to be paid. If the written statement was not received the claim was denied and the CTax account credited. If an application was submitted by the resident or third party for energy rebate to be paid by BACS it went through a credit check in Ascendant which confirmed Identity and Bank account ownership. Those that got a green score after the credit check were approved. Those that received an Amber or Red score were required to provide further evidence to verify identity or the bank account ownership (or both).

The process implemented to administer the energy bills rebate, was consulted with the Council's Audit and Investigations Service before going live. A representative from Audit and Investigations Service is part of the ongoing business working group to advise and support of matters relating to fraud, risk and control. The process adopted ensures an adequate and appropriate separation of duties between processing cases to be paid and approval for payment.

We endeavour to undertake half yearly reviews on Empty Properties and exemptions and discounts where resourcing allows, which helps ensure the validity of our data. Once live, samples of accounts were checked to ensure the reports ran were pulling through data correctly.

This would include ensuring account is live at 01/04/22, is in the requisite ctax band, was occupied and did not have a discounting exemption or discount. There were other reports that we ran on ineligible customers that we then ran checks on against our main ‘eligible’ report. One example of this was checking that no accounts registered as Owner Class C were in the list of accounts deemed eligible, this was done using a vlookup function in Microsoft Excel. We also highlighted cases that had contact addresses linked to accounts and reviewed where possible to establish if customer is not residing at the property.","Our Revenues teams working directly with Council Tax accounts have been briefed on the Energy Rebate. This has allowed for them to be able to identify where a payment has been made in error and create a process for it to be reviewed or recovered where necessary.

Currently we have been reliant on customers who have received the payment contacting us to query whether the payments should have been made. However, now that resource can be freed as the scheme has closed we will be able to undertake further action by re-running reports of who has been paid vs accounts we know not to be eligible and see if there is any overlap.

We continue to work to identify ineligible payments through checking our accounts paid data vs our known ineligible.

Where we have found that an ineligible payment has been made to a council tax account, we are working on a solution to remove these payments.

If they do not know their council tax reference number, the claim form will be prevented from submission. All claims were subjected to checks through the Spotlight tool. Where the Spotlight check suggested a significant or likely risk of fraud associated with the bank account we applied the £150 to the Council Tax account, rather than make a bank transfer and notified the Council tax payer accordingly. ","We undertook various additional assurance activities: - Look for duplicate payments for individuals - Check all HMO properties to ensure that no payments were made - Exercise to ensure that those in annexe properties where the main property was a band D or below did not receive an additional payment. - Exclude annexes where a local discount was applied - Check that no payments were made to deceased account - Apply the payment for properties banded retrospectively, checking all eligibility criteria Where the circumstances for any of the above were unclear, then no payment was made.","no","0","We did not identify any fraud","0","no","","Separation of duties for running extracts and payments, no payment run was ever done alone, there was always at least one senior officer and one case officer involved. The person who ran the extract would not be the authorising officer, this was done by a senior officer to remove the opportunity for fraud. The BACS payment were uploaded securely in CSV format extracted from the NEC system that could not be amended once raised. The amount of the payment was then reconciled by a finance case officer to the authorities' bank statement. ","Where a credit had been applied to the account, this has been reversed, if the payment was by BACS outside of the Council Tax system a Sundry Debt invoice was raised and our normal recovery process commences.","The remaining outstanding balances have received a reminder for payment.","Each case will be considered on its own merit per our recovery and collections policy.","0","Somerton and Frome","E14000932","2777850","82449","18519","","2738","2683","Yeovil","E14001060","6152550","204234","41017","","6694","6581","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Administration of the energy rebate scheme as regards determining entitlement and payment was limited to key senior personnel only. Access restrictions and role permissions were used to prevent staff accessing their own accounts and data. Banking details were subject to checks prior to award and payment, including checks on the validity of the account details and account name together with the customer place of residence. In the case of a real time variance being identified, customers were given an opportunity to correct the data input, otherwise the payment would not be made by BACS and would instead be made by a credit transfer to their Council Tax account. A PIN number sent to the Council Tax Payer at the property or account address was required for access to the customer portal and an online declaration was also used and had to be agreed before payment details submitted were accepted.

The administration of the portal was conducted by our contracted supplier for that purpose and real time checks on the details submitted for banking details and residency were performed and subject to a declaration before acceptance. BACS payments were approved by the Head of Service and payment was issued by a separate department thus ensuring a further segregation of duties in the process.

In accordance with scheme guidance, where council tax records identified the household as eligible, and where council tax was being collected from an active bank account in the name of the party liable for council tax, the payment was made by BACS. Ahead of this however, records were interrogated to further validate the appropriateness of the award, by making sure that the named party or parties only appeared within the council's open accounts on the eligibility date once, to avoid making multiple payments to landlords, who are ineligible. Where we were satisfied that the payment could be made, but either held no bank account details, or were unable to satisfy ourselves of the reason why the name of a bank account differed to the name of the person liable for council tax, the council tax account holder was contacted in writing with a request to submit their details via a secure website to enable their application to be processed. The written request included a time limited key to be used in conjunction with the council tax account number to enable the information to be submitted to us.

The resulting list was then manually checked to ensure no obvious errors. Additional newly eligible cases were picked up by the energy payment module run just before crediting the accounts.","","","","Accounts have been selected and paid using Council Tax data in NEC Revenues & Benefits by two Systems Administrators. Selected accounts were filtered for obvious errors (e.g., companies/trusts/deceased accounts). All accounts held on spreadsheet and marked when paid to avoid duplication. This spreadsheet then reconciled with NEC report. The spreadsheet has been held centrally and available to inspect by finance and revenues managers. Council Tax officers were advised to communicate any account changes where an account becomes ineligible in order that any unclaimed vouchers could be cancelled, or the customer invoiced if they’d already received a BACS payment. BACS details were reviewed to ensure the account details matched the liable party name and any that didn’t were referred to council tax officers to investigate. Accounts selected as eligible were initially set to approved and then subsequently set to paid once payment had processed. This prevented double payments being made. Any accounts that weren't clearly eligible were set to pending, and then either rejected or approved once investigated. This prevented erroneous payments. The software has built in validation checks to ensure the customer is still liable on 1st April 2022 when trying to create a payment file. The software will check the 1st Direct Debit in April had successfully collected before allowing the payment to be made.","Regular reconciliation and sample checking done.

All data was held on a central spreadsheet which reconciled regularly with system to ensure both match. Detailed reports on vouchers issued were available to the manager through the Post Office website. BACS payments had to be authorised by a manager and any BACS file submissions were flagged to all authorising signatories. Details of credits to council tax accounts were passed to the Finance manager. Strict procedures are in place for refunds of any credits we've applied to the council tax account, requiring signed refund forms and then authorised by a manager prior to BACS payment. Payments were only able to be made for council tax accounts that had a live band as of 1st April. The number of properties is reconciled by band weekly with the Valuation Office Agency schedules so any extra properties would soon be identified. Any attempts to create fraudulent council tax accounts would have been picked up by council tax team leaders through their monitoring reports.","Where credits have been applied directly to accounts, these have been reversed once we are aware of the payment no longer being eligible. Where an account has had a BACS payment made, or a voucher cashed, invoices have been raised. If someone has been paid in error by BACS or voucher and has a credit balance when their council tax account is closed, the refund has been reduced accordingly to repay the ineligible payment.","There are 6 outstanding invoices totalling £900 which have not been challenged at this stage. A reminder will be issued and then judged on a case-by-case basis as to whether further action is warranted.","There are two payments that we do not intend to pursue, and the invoices have been withdrawn.
