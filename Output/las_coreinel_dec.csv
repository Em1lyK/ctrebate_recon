However, the payment recipient was subsequently eligible for the energy rebate on a newly created council tax account. Rather than ask the taxpayer for the energy rebate to be repaid, and then pay it again to the same person on their new account, we took the decision to offset the payment against the new council tax account and we have noted the council tax account to reflect that. We have 184 accounts in these circumstances but as we have only actually made one payment to the taxpayer we have decided to not include these as ineligible on the return. Instead, they are eligible payments, made to the correct qualifying taxpayer, but on a different council tax account reference. For clarification these taxpayers have only received one energy rebate payment."
